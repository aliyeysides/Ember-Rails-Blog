[["body", "<hr>\n\n<p>SQL injection is a hacking technique that uses sql queries to trick and identify important information within an applications database. Injected SQL commands can alter SQL statements and compromise the security of a web application. When a site has a search bar or a field to enter a user id or email or even password, it will typically have a sql server code that enters your input such as this:</p>\n\n<p><code><br>\ninput = text text text<br>\nSELECT * FROM users<br>\nWHERE userID = “text text text“;<br>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering an incorrect input, the user can enter some conditional input like: <code>x=x</code>, which is always true. So <code>WHERE x=x</code> is true, which it is, the server code above would return everything from the current field. This leaves important information like passwords and emails extremely vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>Even worse, someone could theoretically continue to put further SQL commands that can alter the database. They can insert their own information, change someone’s email or password, or even drop the entire table all together.</p>\n\n<p>Safe measures to prevent such attacks include setting up sql prepared statements. Prepared statements ensure that an attacker is not able to change the intent of a query, even if SQL commands are inserted by an attacker. In the same example above, if an attacker were to enter the userID of: <code>x&#39; or &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1</code>, the parameterized query would not be vulnerable and would instead look for a username which literally matched the entire string <code>x&#39; or &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another method is to create stored procedures. Stored procedures have the same effect as the use of prepared statements when implemented safely. They require the developer to define the SQL code first, and then pass in the parameters after. The difference between prepared statements and stored procedures is that the SQL code for a stored procedure is defined and stored in the database itself, and then called from the application. Both of these techniques have the same effectiveness in preventing SQL injection so your organization should choose which approach makes the most sense for you.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a great resource that list techniques on protecting your site/app against SQL inject attacks: <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet\">OWASP.ORG</a></p>\n"], ["created_at", Tue, 20 Jan 2015 17:54:34 UTC +00:00], ["date", "Sep. 21st, 2014"], ["title", "SQL Injection Hacking"], ["updated_at", Tue, 20 Jan 2015 17:54:34 UTC +00:00]]

The following are two different methods that I use frequently to get the job done.</p>\n\n<h2>Enumberable#Map</h2>\n\n<p>Map is probably the most common of the two because of it&#39;s simplicity and versitility. Map performs an action on each collection element, however, the original collection is not modified. This is what the destructive <code>.map!</code> is for. Below is an example of how map can be used.</p>\n\n<p><code><br>\narray = [1,2,3]<br>\narray.map {|x| x += x}<br>\nwhich returns [2,4,6]<br>\nbut array still equals [1,2,3]<br>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>In the following example, we have established an array that contains the elements <code>1,2,3</code>. Then, we use the map method to iterate over each element that we have named <code>x</code>. We then pass a block of code to map and tell it that we want to add each <code>x</code> element with <code>x</code>, so what this will return is <code>[2,4,6]</code>, but the original array will still be <code>[1,2,3]</code> if called upon. If we wanted to change the underlying array, we would use the <code>.map!</code> destructive method and the return would be <code>[2,4,6]</code> and so would the array if called on again.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s try another example. This time we want to pass a block to the array and gather all the elements that equates to truthy values.</p>\n\n<p><code><br>\narray = [1,2,3]<br>\narray.map {|x| x &gt;= 2}<br>\nreturns [false, true, true]<br>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Wait, what happened here? We iterated over all the elements of array and said we want <code>x</code> if it&#39;s greater than or equal to <code>2</code>. Weren&#39;t we supposed to get <code>[2,3]</code> as a return? Well, no. Map gathers all elements to modify them. In this case, we are not modifying the elements of the array, we are simply saying we want only the elements that equate to true when passed. This is what <code>.select</code> is for.</p>\n\n<h2>Enumerable#Select</h2>\n\n<p>So let&#39;s take the previous example and try it with select:</p>\n\n<p><code><br>\narray = [1,2,3]<br>\narray.select {|x| x &gt;= 2}<br>\nreturns [2,3]<br>\nbut array still equals [1,2,3]<br>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>What select does is iterate over each element like we did with map, but returns a collection for which the given block, <code>x &gt;= 2</code>, returns a true value. Just like map, this returns the new values but does not change the underlying collection.</p>\n"], ["created_at", Tue, 20 Jan 2015 17:54:34 UTC +00:00], ["date", "Aug 30th, 2014"], ["title", "Enumerables in Ruby and their practices"], ["updated_at", Tue, 20 Jan 2015 17:54:34 UTC +00:00]]

With the commitment mounting up and the material beginning to pick up speed, Shereef underlined the importance of taking this program seriously and highlighted the mindset and questions we should have coming into Dev Bootcamp. I knew it was going to be a challenge, but I also had a lot of preconceived notions that it would take a good amount of raw talent and intelligence which worried me about how I&#39;d fit in. </p>\n\n<p>I was never concerned with fitting in regards to culture seeing as how I&#39;ve been working in a similar industry and had a background in computer hardware prior to entering DBC. I was afraid I was going to be a slow learner and drag people behind. Shereef really cleared this up for me. He made it very clear that raw intelligence, clearly an overrated term, had little to nothing to do with learning to be a software engineer, and that it takes an undying commitment and a starving eagerness to learn and build to really succeed in this program. I see myself thriving in this type of environment where I get to take control of my own education and learn by doing and asking when I make mistakes. And, the fact that saying &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39; is encouraged at DBC brings me a sense of comfort. </p>\n\n<p>My expectations of DBC are definitely much higher now because I know they ask the same of me. I want to succeed because they truely want me to succeed. I never had an oppurtunity to receive this type of support and education. I am so excited for the program to begin, although the prep phase is a lot of work already, I can&#39;t wait to forge new relationships with my mentors, classmates, and most importantely, to learn.</p>\n"], ["created_at", Tue, 20 Jan 2015 17:54:34 UTC +00:00], ["date", "Aug 9th, 2014"], ["title", "My Reaction to Shereef's Fireside Chat"], ["updated_at", Tue, 20 Jan 2015 17:54:34 UTC +00:00]]
